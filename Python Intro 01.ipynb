    "If you start to write Python scripts, you should ideally use something like the following as the first two lines:\n",

    "```\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is relevant on Unix (incl. Linux) as it tells the system what interpreter to use. The second one is a hint to the Python interpreter itself that the file is encoded as UTF-8. If you use any non-English characters or non-Latin alphabets or want to sprinkle your scripts with emojis this is the encoding you will need. UTF-8 is a default, so for the most part you don't need to know more. When in doubt, approach one of the more tech-savvy folks and ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "* On Windows prefer to use the Python Launcher `py.exe` which comes installed by default in recent Python versions\n",
    "    * Example: `py -3 .\\myscript.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Python script `foobar.py`, you could also place a `foobar.cmd` next to that and populate the `.cmd` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "py -3 \"%~dpn0.py\" %*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow you to double click the script or conveniently start it from a console window. Throw in a `@pause` as second line to have the console window remain once the Python script finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This little wrapper script will simply invoke a script by its own name with `.cmd` replaced by `.py` and passing all command line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "* On Linux you need to make sure to set the x bit in the file mode. So with a `foobar.py` you'd run `chmod +x foobar.py` to make it executable\n",
    "    * This _requires_ the first line starting with `#!` from the common part above! This line is variously called \"shebang\" and \"hashbang\" owed to the fact that `#` is often called the hash sign and `!` is colloquially called bang, e.g. in American English."
